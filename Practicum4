   <h2> A Tip For Beginners From Body Break </h2> 
   <p> For beginners, most experts recommend at least 20 minutes of exercise three times a week. These 20 minutes can be a combination of four 5-minute sessions of exercise, two 10-minute sessions or 20 continuous minutes. Just doing something is better than no exercise at all. Here is a suggested table to help motivate you to make that a reality, and keep it interesting! Find 20 minutes, 3 times a week, and divide it up according to the table to keep things light and simple to begin. Working out is supposed to be fun after all.</p>
